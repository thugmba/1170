### Industry Analysis

# Tips for Success

## Analysis Approach

1. **Start Early**: Begin with company selection in Week 1
2. **Collect Data First**: Download all 5 years of annual reports before starting analysis
3. **Create Timeline**: Map major strategic moves chronologically
4. **Financial First**: Review financial trends before diving into concepts
5. **Connect Concepts**: Look for relationships between different concepts
6. **Be Critical**: Not all concepts may apply equally - explain why

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Too descriptive**: Don't just describe what the company does - analyze WHY
- **Ignoring financials**: Every strategic claim should link to financial evidence
- **Concept forcing**: If a concept doesn't strongly apply, briefly explain why
- **Lack of evolution**: Show CHANGE over 5 years, not just current state
- **No recommendations**: Don't just analyze - suggest improvements

## Writing Quality

- Use business-appropriate language
- Define technical terms
- Use active voice
- Include transition sentences
- Proofread carefully
- Use tables and figures effectively

---

# Academic Integrity

## Plagiarism Warning

All work must be original. Proper citation is required for:

- Direct quotes
- Paraphrased ideas
- Data and statistics
- Images and figures (except company logos used fairly)

## Use of AI Tools

(Instructor to specify policy - suggested language below)

You may use AI tools (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.) for:

- ✓ Brainstorming and ideation
- ✓ Proofreading and grammar checking
- ✓ Understanding concepts

You may NOT use AI tools for:

- ✗ Writing substantial portions of your report
- ✗ Conducting the analysis
- ✗ Creating your strategic recommendations

All AI use must be disclosed in an appendix.
